# EafitSpaces Web Application

Welcome to the **EafitSpaces** project!

## Purpose

At EAFIT University, there are countless spaces available for different uses such as teaching, tutoring, student group meetings, administrative meetings, and much more. However, booking these spaces has often been cumbersome, requiring forms or in-person reservations. But worry no more! With **EafitSpaces**, we aim to create a web application that allows users to search and reserve available spaces quickly and efficiently.

## Scope

No more running around to find a room! **EafitSpaces** is a user-friendly web application designed to streamline the process of searching for available rooms and reserving them at EAFIT University. This platform caters to students, professors, and administrative staff alike, offering the convenience of browsing, reserving, and managing spaces in real-time.

Whether you're looking to book a classroom for a lecture or an auditorium for an event, **EafitSpaces** has got you covered. Plus, it allows administrative staff to manage spaces efficiently and keep track of statistics with ease!
